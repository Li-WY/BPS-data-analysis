# Example config YAML file for itermae.
 
# Syntax details:
#   - # are comments
#   - ':'s denote a key-value relationship, like
#     'key: value'
#   - '-'s preface array/list elements, so this is a list and order matters
#   - order of keys does not matter
#   - things inside a key-value (a ':') or inside a list (a '-') need to be 
#     indented at least two spaces, and be consistent
#   - strings can be in quotes or not, but I use them below for explicit
#     consistency (except for true / false values, which are specified without
#     quotes)
