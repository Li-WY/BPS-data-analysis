# TODO

- Change to more gracefully handle lots of plasmids multiplexed together,
    ie take a list of reference fastas for trimming, and how decide which
    plasmid it is? Also, can we it skip a trim?
- Genbank for config of itermaes and such
- Optional target seq, optional known barcodes
- Trim is doing it four times
